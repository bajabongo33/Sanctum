      'Long before humans wrote history, trees kept it. Their rings are calendars, their roots hold conversations, and their silence is wiser than most words.',
      'When we walk among forests, we walk inside memory — not ours, but Earth’s. Every breath we take has passed through a thousand leaves, and every thought finds stillness near bark.',
      'Eldar reminds us: a tree doesn’t need to speak to teach. It simply stands, and so must we.'
